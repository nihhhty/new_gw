        4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technology
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        Our Services may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies (collectively “Cookies”) to automatically collect users’ information (including personal information).  Cookies are small data files that are transferred to users’ web browsers and/or stored on their devices as they are browsing.  We may use Cookies to improve our Services and make your user experience online more customized and efficient.  Among other uses, Cookies help us recognize repeat users, facilitate users’ access to and use of BR Websites, and track users’ behavior on websites they visit.  We may compile aggregate data for statistical purposes to improve the content of our sites or to better administer the web pages available on the sites.
        <br><br>
        Web beacons are used to tell us how and when pages in our sites are visited, by how many people, their point of origin and operating system and to monitor performance with our Services.

        5. How long do we keep your information
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
        <br><br>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
        <br><br>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        6. How do we keep your information safe
      </div>
      <div class="T_content">
        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
        <br><br>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.

        In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have additional rights to access and control your personal information. You can review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
        <br><br>
        In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These rights may include (i) the right to request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) the right to request correction or deletion, (iii) the right to restrict the processing of your personal information, and (iv) if applicable, the right to data portability.

        <br><br>
        If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that this will not affect the lawfulness of processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information carried out in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and you believe that we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
